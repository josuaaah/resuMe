# ResuMe
ResuMe is an application targeted at University students. It allows students to consolidate their personal achievements and projects, select specific achievements and generate aesthetically-pleasing resumes automatically.

## Milestone 1
We are now at the first iteration of our development, where we aim to create the following features:
- Ability to serve a single user
- Ability to add Personal Projects to a user's list of achievements
- Ability to generate plain text resumes to be saved as PDF
